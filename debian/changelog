webp-viewer (0.5.0-1) UNRELEASED; urgency=medium

  * The viewer can now handle multiple files. A user can now pass paths to
    multiple image files as arguments, and the viewer will allow to cycle
    through those files with the D or right arrow key and A or left arrow key,
    respectively.

  * Furthermore, the name of the image file is now shown in the window title,
    and if the program was called with more than one image file to show, then
    the index of the image is shown in the title, too.
